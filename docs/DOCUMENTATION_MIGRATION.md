# Documentation Migration Guide

This guide helps you find updated documentation after the reorganization.

## What Changed?

The documentation has been **consolidated and reorganized** for better clarity:
- 10 summary files archived (completed work)
- New comprehensive main documentation created
- Clear index and navigation added
- Current status clearly separated from historical records

## Finding Documentation

### Old → New Mapping

| Old File | New Location | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Multiple summary files | [DOCUMENTATION.md](../DOCUMENTATION.md) | Consolidated into one comprehensive guide |
| Epic summaries | [docs/archive/summaries/](archive/summaries/) | Archived for reference |
| Bug fix summaries | [docs/archive/summaries/](archive/summaries/) | Archived for reference |
| Test coverage updates | [docs/archive/summaries/](archive/summaries/) | Archived for reference |
| README.md | [README.md](../README.md) | Updated with links to new docs |
| Scattered docs | [docs/INDEX.md](INDEX.md) | Organized with clear index |

### Quick Reference

**Need to:**
- **Get started quickly?** → [DOCUMENTATION.md](../DOCUMENTATION.md) Quick Start section
- **Deploy to production?** → [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md)
- **Run tests?** → [docs/TESTING.md](TESTING.md)
- **Understand architecture?** → [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Find specific doc?** → [docs/INDEX.md](INDEX.md)
- **Check project status?** → [PROJECT_STATUS.md](../PROJECT_STATUS.md)

## Archived Documentation

The following files have been **archived** (not deleted):
- `BUGFIX_SUMMARY.md`
- `BUG_FIXES_SUMMARY.md`
- `ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- `EPIC_A_SUMMARY.md`
- `EPIC_B_SUMMARY.md`
- `EPIC_C_SUMMARY.md`
- `FIX_SUMMARY.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_PROFILE_FIX.md`
- `TEST_COVERAGE_UPDATE.md`

**Location:** [docs/archive/summaries/](archive/summaries/)

These are kept for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Single source of truth** - Main documentation in one place
2. **Clear navigation** - Index shows all available docs
3. **Up-to-date information** - Active docs separated from historical
4. **Better searchability** - Organized by topic
5. **Easier maintenance** - Less duplication

## Questions?

If you can't find something:
1. Check [docs/INDEX.md](INDEX.md) - Complete documentation list
2. Search the repository - Use GitHub search or IDE search
3. Check [archive/summaries/](archive/summaries/) - Historical implementation details
4. Open an issue - We'll help you find it!
