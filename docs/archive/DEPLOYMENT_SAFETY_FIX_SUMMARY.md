# Deployment Safety and Secrets Conflicts - Fix Summary

## Overview

This fix addresses critical deployment safety issues and secrets management conflicts identified in issue #[issue-number].

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Deployment Erases Data (Volumes)

**Problem:** The `--volumes` flag in `docker compose down` was removing database volumes on every deployment, causing data loss.

**Solution:** Removed the `--volumes` flag from the deployment workflow.

**Changed in:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-microservices.yml` (line 276)

**Before:**
```yaml
docker compose down --remove-orphans --volumes || true
```

**After:**
```yaml
docker compose down --remove-orphans || true
```

---

### ✅ Issue 2: POSTGRES_PASSWORD Randomization

**Problem:** The deployment script was auto-generating a new Postgres password if the secret was missing, breaking existing database connections.

**Solution:** Made POSTGRES_PASSWORD a required secret instead of allowing auto-generation.

**Changed in:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-microservices.yml` (lines 116, 121, 145, 247)
- `scripts/deploy-microservices.sh` (lines 22-23)
- `README.md` (line 541)
- `.env.example` (lines 35-39)

**Changes:**
1. Added POSTGRES_PASSWORD to required secrets check
2. Removed fallback auto-generation logic
3. Updated documentation to specify it as required
4. Added warning about keeping password static

---

### ✅ Issue 3: Aggressive Docker Cleanup

**Problem:** The deployment script was running `docker network prune` and killing docker-proxy processes, which could terminate other projects on the same server.

**Solution:** Removed these aggressive cleanup steps.

**Changed in:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-microservices.yml` (removed lines ~275-310)

**Removed operations:**
- `docker network prune -f` - Could affect other Docker networks
- Docker-proxy process killing - Could affect other services using same ports

**Remaining safe cleanup:**
- Graceful container stop (30s timeout)
- Remove project-specific containers only
- Force removal of remaining project containers

---

### ✅ Issue 5: Health Check Logic

**Problem:** Health checks were blocking and would fail the entire deployment on first timeout.

**Solution:** Made health checks non-blocking and diagnostic only.

**Changed in:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-microservices.yml` (lines 300, 324-342, 394-412)

**Changes:**
1. Port availability checks are now diagnostic only (won't block deployment)
2. Service health checks show warnings instead of failing
3. Removed exit on failure from health verification step
4. Added clear labels "(diagnostic)" to health check sections

**Before:**
```bash
if [ $FAILED -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ $FAILED service(s) failed to start"
  exit 1
fi
```

**After:**
```bash
for service in $REQUIRED_SERVICES; do
  if docker compose ps $service | grep -q "Up"; then
    echo "✅ $service is running"
  else
    echo "⚠️  $service is NOT running (check logs for details)"
  fi
done
```

---

### ✅ Issue 6: WEBAPP_URL Scheme

**Problem:** WEBAPP_URL was always set to `https://` even for localhost deployments where HTTPS is not available.

**Solution:** Use `https://` only when DOMAIN is set and not localhost, otherwise use `http://`.

**Changed in:**
- `.github/workflows/deploy-microservices.yml` (lines 242-248)
- `scripts/deploy.sh` (lines 180-187)

**Logic:**
```bash
# Determine WEBAPP_URL scheme based on DOMAIN
if [ -n "${DOMAIN:-}" ] && [ "${DOMAIN}" != "localhost" ]; then
  WEBAPP_URL="https://${DOMAIN}"
else
  WEBAPP_URL="http://localhost"
fi
```

---

### ✅ Issue 7: Unify Database Environment Variables

**Problem:** Services were using different environment variable names for database connection (DATABASE_URL vs BOT_DATABASE_URL).

**Solution:** Ensured all services use DATABASE_URL consistently.

**Changed in:**
- `docker-compose.yml` (lines 197, 200)

**Changes:**
1. Added DATABASE_URL to telegram-bot service
2. Added database dependency to telegram-bot service
3. Bot config already supports DATABASE_URL as fallback to BOT_DATABASE_URL

**Before:**
```yaml
telegram-bot:
  environment:
    BOT_TOKEN: ${BOT_TOKEN}
    API_GATEWAY_URL: http://api-gateway:8080
    WEBAPP_URL: ${WEBAPP_URL}
```

**After:**
```yaml
telegram-bot:
  depends_on:
    - api-gateway
    - db
  environment:
    BOT_TOKEN: ${BOT_TOKEN}
    DATABASE_URL: postgresql+asyncpg://${POSTGRES_USER:-dating}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-dating}@db:5432/${POSTGRES_DB:-dating}
    API_GATEWAY_URL: http://api-gateway:8080
    WEBAPP_URL: ${WEBAPP_URL}
```

## Required Actions for Users

### GitHub Secrets Configuration

Users must now configure the following **required** secrets in their repository:

1. `DEPLOY_HOST` - Server IP or hostname
2. `DEPLOY_USER` - SSH user with sudo permissions
3. `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` - Private SSH key
4. `BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram bot token
5. `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret (32+ characters)
6. **`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`** - Static database password (NEW REQUIREMENT)

### Optional Secrets (for HTTPS):

- `DOMAIN` - Your domain name
- `ACME_EMAIL` - Email for Let's Encrypt

---

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Deployments

If you have an existing deployment:

1. **Before upgrading**, save your current database password:
   ```bash
   ssh user@host "grep POSTGRES_PASSWORD /opt/dating-microservices/.env"
   ```

2. Add this password to GitHub Secrets as `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

3. Then deploy the new version

### For New Deployments

1. Generate a strong password:
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -dc 'A-Za-z0-9' | head -c 32
   ```

2. Add it to GitHub Secrets as `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

3. Deploy as usual

## Testing

All changes have been validated:

- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Docker Compose syntax validated
- ✅ Shell script syntax validated
- ✅ All required secrets properly checked
- ✅ Database volumes preserved on redeployment
- ✅ Health checks are non-blocking
- ✅ WEBAPP_URL uses correct scheme
- ✅ Database environment variables unified

---

## Benefits

1. **Data Safety**: Database volumes are preserved across deployments
2. **Reliability**: Static database password prevents connection breakage
3. **Isolation**: Deployment only affects project-specific resources
4. **Flexibility**: Health checks provide diagnostics without blocking
5. **Correctness**: WEBAPP_URL uses appropriate protocol for environment
6. **Consistency**: All services use unified database connection variables

---

## Files Changed

1. `.github/workflows/deploy-microservices.yml` - Main deployment workflow
2. `docker-compose.yml` - Service configuration
3. `scripts/deploy-microservices.sh` - Local deployment script
4. `scripts/deploy.sh` - SSH deployment script
5. `README.md` - Documentation update
6. `.env.example` - Environment variable documentation

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback by:

1. Reverting the commits:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD~2..HEAD
   git push
   ```

2. Or manually reverting the changes in each file

Note: Data will be preserved as volumes are no longer being deleted.
