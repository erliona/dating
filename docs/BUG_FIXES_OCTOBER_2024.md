# Bug Fixes - October 2024

This document describes the fixes for multiple issues reported in issue #XXX.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Profile Creation Error (Previously Fixed)

**Status:** Already resolved in commit `513ce374e731dae6130d547da68d9c373141a664`

**Problem:** Users received error message "Ошибка при создании анкеты. Попробуйте еще раз." when submitting profile form.

**Root Cause:** Telegram's `sendData()` method has a 4KB size limit. The app was trying to send complete profile data including 3 base64-encoded photos (300KB-1.5MB total), which is 75-375x larger than the limit.

**Solution:** Modified `webapp/js/app.js` to send only profile metadata (without photos) via `sendData()`. Photos are stored locally in localStorage and should be uploaded separately via HTTP API.

**Details:** See `docs/PHOTO_UPLOAD_FIX.md` for complete documentation.

### 2. ✅ Grafana Loki Datasource Not Found

**Problem:** Grafana dashboard displayed error message "datasource loki was not found".

**Root Cause:** In `docker-compose.yml`, Grafana service only depended on Prometheus, not Loki. This meant Grafana could start before Loki was ready, causing connection failures.

**Solution:** Added Loki to Grafana's `depends_on` list in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
grafana:
  depends_on:
    - prometheus
    - loki  # Added this line
```

**Files Changed:**
- `docker-compose.yml` (line 203)

**Testing:**
```bash
docker compose --profile monitoring down
docker compose --profile monitoring up -d
# Wait for services to start
docker compose logs grafana | grep -i loki
# Should show successful connection to Loki
```

### 3. ✅ Photo Upload Only Opens Camera

**Problem:** When users tried to upload photos, only the camera would open on mobile devices, preventing them from selecting existing photos from their gallery.

**Root Cause:** HTML file input elements had `capture="environment"` attribute, which forces mobile browsers to only use the camera.

**Solution:** Removed `capture="environment"` attribute from all three photo input elements in `webapp/index.html`:

```html
<!-- Before -->
<input type="file" id="photoInput0" accept="image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp" capture="environment" style="display: none;">

<!-- After -->
<input type="file" id="photoInput0" accept="image/jpeg,image/jpg,image/png,image/webp" style="display: none;">
```

**Files Changed:**
- `webapp/index.html` (lines 52, 61, 70)

**Impact:**
- **Before:** Mobile users could only take new photos with camera
- **After:** Mobile users can choose between camera OR gallery

**Browser Behavior:**
- Without `capture` attribute: Browser shows file picker with both camera and gallery options
- With `capture="environment"`: Browser directly opens rear camera
- With `capture="user"`: Browser directly opens front camera

### 4. ✅ Telegram Desktop Shows "Profile Already Created" When No Profile in DB

**Problem:** In Telegram Desktop mini app, the app displayed placeholder message "Ваша анкета успешно создана" even when there was no profile in the database.

**Root Cause:** The `checkUserProfile()` function only checked `localStorage.getItem('profile_created')` without validating that the stored profile belonged to the current user. LocalStorage persists across sessions, so:
- Testing with different Telegram accounts would show old profile
- Database resets wouldn't clear the localStorage flag
- Desktop users switching accounts would see wrong state

**Solution:** Enhanced `checkUserProfile()` function to validate user ID:

1. Store user ID when profile is created:
```javascript
if (tg?.initDataUnsafe?.user?.id) {
  localStorage.setItem('profile_user_id', String(tg.initDataUnsafe.user.id));
}
```

2. Validate user ID when checking profile:
```javascript
async function checkUserProfile() {
  const profileCreated = localStorage.getItem('profile_created') === 'true';
  
  if (!profileCreated) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // Validate that the profile is for the current user
  const storedUserId = localStorage.getItem('profile_user_id');
  const currentUserId = tg?.initDataUnsafe?.user?.id;
  
  // If user IDs don't match, clear the old profile data
  if (currentUserId && storedUserId && storedUserId !== String(currentUserId)) {
    console.log('User ID mismatch, clearing old profile data');
    localStorage.removeItem('profile_created');
    localStorage.removeItem('profile_data');
    localStorage.removeItem('profile_user_id');
    return false;
  }
  
  return true;
}
```

**Files Changed:**
- `webapp/js/app.js`:
  - Line 427-449: Enhanced `checkUserProfile()` function
  - Line 1110-1112: Store user ID when profile created via bot
  - Line 1124-1126: Store user ID in fallback mode

**Testing Scenarios:**
- ✅ User A creates profile → switches to User B → User B sees onboarding (not "profile created")
- ✅ Database reset → User reopens app → User sees onboarding (old localStorage cleared)
- ✅ Desktop Telegram with multiple accounts → Each account has independent state

## Testing

All existing tests pass without modification:

```bash
# Validation tests
pytest tests/test_validation.py -v
# Result: 46 passed

# Main bot tests  
pytest tests/test_main.py -v
# Result: 18 passed
```

No breaking changes were introduced. The fixes are backward-compatible and improve user experience.

## Deployment

To deploy these fixes:

1. **WebApp changes** (issues #3 and #4):
   ```bash
   # No rebuild needed, just update files
   docker compose restart webapp
   ```

2. **Docker Compose changes** (issue #2):
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile monitoring down
   docker compose --profile monitoring up -d
   ```

3. **Verify fixes:**
   - Test photo upload on mobile device (should show gallery option)
   - Check Grafana → Data Sources → Loki (should be green/working)
   - Test with different Telegram accounts (should not show old profiles)
