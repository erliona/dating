# Bug Fix: Deployment Health Check Improvement

**Issue**: GitHub Actions deployment health check not detecting unhealthy containers  
**Run**: [#18233239496](https://github.com/erliona/dating/actions/runs/18233239496/job/51921412541)  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Date**: October 3, 2025

---

## Problem

The deployment workflow health check was using a simple `grep -q "Up"` pattern to verify if containers were running. This approach had a critical flaw: it would match containers in various states that include "Up" in their status, even if they weren't actually healthy.

### Examples of False Positives

The old check would pass for:
- ✅ `Up` - Actually healthy and running
- ❌ `Up (health: starting)` - Still initializing, not ready
- ❌ `Up Restarting` - In a restart loop, not functional
- ❌ `Up (unhealthy)` - Running but health check failing

### Impact

This caused deployments to appear successful even when:
- Bot container was in a restart loop
- Services were still initializing
- Health checks were failing
- Containers were not actually functional

---

## Root Cause

The health check logic in both `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` used basic string matching:

```bash
# Old (incorrect) approach
if ! docker compose ps bot | grep -q "Up"; then
    echo "::error::Bot container is not running!"
    exit 1
fi
```

This only verified that the text "Up" appeared somewhere in the container status, not that the container was actually healthy.

---

## Solution

Improved the health check to use Docker Compose's JSON output format, which provides structured data about container state and health:

```bash
# New (correct) approach
BOT_STATUS=$(docker compose ps bot --format json 2>/dev/null || echo '{}')
if echo "$BOT_STATUS" | grep -q '"State":"running"'; then
    # Check if container has health check and if it's healthy
    if echo "$BOT_STATUS" | grep -q '"Health":'; then
        if ! echo "$BOT_STATUS" | grep -q '"Health":"healthy"'; then
            echo "::error::Bot container is running but unhealthy!"
            docker compose ps bot
            docker compose logs --tail=50 bot
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
    echo "✓ Bot container is running and healthy"
else
    echo "::error::Bot container is not running!"
    docker compose ps bot
    docker compose logs --tail=50 bot
    exit 1
fi
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Uses JSON format**: Structured data instead of text parsing
2. **Checks State**: Explicitly verifies `"State":"running"`
3. **Validates Health**: If health check exists, ensures it's `"healthy"`
4. **Better Error Messages**: Shows actual status and logs when checks fail
5. **Handles Edge Cases**: Works correctly even when health checks are not configured

---

## Code Changes

### 1. Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)

**Bot Container Check** (lines 637-657):
- Changed from simple grep to JSON-based verification
- Added explicit health status validation
- Improved error messages with container status and logs

**Database Container Check** (lines 659-679):
- Applied the same improvements as bot container
- Ensures database is not just "Up" but actually healthy

**Monitoring Services Check** (lines 682-718):
- Created reusable `check_monitoring_service()` function
- Iterates over all monitoring services with consistent logic
- Reports warnings instead of errors for optional services

### 2. CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Monitoring Stack Check** (lines 130-169):
- Created reusable `check_service_health()` function
- Applied to loki, promtail, grafana, and prometheus
- Fails the build if any required monitoring service is unhealthy

## Testing

### Unit Tests

All 281 existing tests still pass:
```bash
$ python -m pytest tests/ -v
============================= 281 passed in 7.60s ==============================
```

### Health Check Logic Tests

Created validation script to test all scenarios:
```bash
$ bash /tmp/test_health_check.sh
Test 1: Running and healthy container          ✓ PASS
Test 2: Running but unhealthy container        ✓ PASS
Test 3: Not running container                  ✓ PASS
Test 4: Running container without health check ✓ PASS
Test 5: Empty status (error case)              ✓ PASS
```

### Workflow Validation

```bash
$ python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/deploy.yml'))"
✓ Valid YAML

$ python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml'))"
✓ Valid YAML
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Deployment Workflow

**Before Fix**:
- ❌ Passes even when containers are restarting
- ❌ No visibility into actual health status
- ❌ False positives for "Up (starting)" states

**After Fix**:
- ✅ Fails if containers are unhealthy
- ✅ Shows actual container status and logs
- ✅ Distinguishes between running and healthy
- ✅ Clear error messages for debugging

### CI Workflow

**Before Fix**:
- ❌ Only checks if services have "Up" in status
- ❌ Continues even with unhealthy services

**After Fix**:
- ✅ Validates actual health status
- ✅ Fails fast with clear error messages
- ✅ Shows service status and logs on failure

---

## Monitoring

After deployment, verify services are healthy:

```bash
# Check all services health
docker compose ps --format json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.Name): \(.State) (\(.Health // "no-healthcheck"))"'

# Expected output:
# dating-bot-1: running (healthy)
# dating-db-1: running (healthy)
# dating-grafana-1: running (healthy)
# dating-loki-1: running
# dating-prometheus-1: running
# dating-promtail-1: running
```

---

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always use JSON format** when parsing Docker Compose status
2. **Explicitly check State field** instead of grepping output text
3. **Validate health status** when health checks are configured
4. **Test edge cases** like starting, restarting, unhealthy states
5. **Add clear error messages** with container status and logs
