# Bug Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for issues reported in issue #[number].

## Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: WebApp Data Not Reaching Database
**Status**: Already Fixed ‚úÖ

This issue was already resolved in a previous commit. The bot correctly uses `ReplyKeyboardMarkup` with `KeyboardButton` (instead of `InlineKeyboardMarkup`) to enable data submission from the WebApp back to the bot via the `F.web_app_data` filter.

**Location**: `bot/main.py` lines 567-580

No changes needed for this issue.

### Issue #2: Datasource Loki Was Not Found
**Status**: Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The Loki datasource might not be properly recognized by Grafana due to missing explicit UID for Prometheus datasource.

**Solution**: Added explicit `uid: prometheus` to the Prometheus datasource configuration for consistency with Loki datasource which already had `uid: loki`.

**Changes**:
- **File**: `monitoring/grafana/provisioning/datasources/datasources.yml`
- **Change**: Added `uid: prometheus` to Prometheus datasource configuration (line 7)

This ensures both datasources have explicit UIDs that match their names, making them easier to reference in dashboards and reducing potential provisioning issues.

### Issue #3: Application Closes After Interaction
**Status**: Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The WebApp closes after every like/dislike/settings change because `tg.sendData()` is designed by Telegram to always close the WebApp. This creates poor UX when users want to browse multiple profiles.

**Root Cause**: Telegram's `tg.sendData()` API is intentionally designed to close the WebApp after sending data. This cannot be changed.

**Solution**: Implemented a queuing system that stores interactions and settings locally, then sends them in batch when the user submits their profile.

**Changes**:

1. **WebApp (`webapp/js/app.js`)**:
   - Added `INTERACTIONS_QUEUE_KEY` constant for local storage
   - Added `getInteractionsQueue()` function to retrieve queued interactions
   - Added `saveInteractionsQueue()` function to persist interactions
   - Added `queueInteraction()` function to queue like/dislike actions
   - Modified `sendInteraction()` to queue instead of sending immediately
   - Modified profile submission to include queued interactions and settings
   - Modified settings save to only save locally (not send immediately)
   - Added visual feedback showing queue count (e.g., "‚ù§Ô∏è –°–∏–º–ø–∞—Ç–∏—è —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω—ë–Ω (2 –≤ –æ—á–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∏)")

2. **Bot (`bot/main.py`)**:
   - Added processing of `queued_interactions` array in `webapp_handler`
   - Added processing of `settings` object in `webapp_handler`
   - Both are processed when profile is submitted/updated
   - Uses existing `handle_interaction()` and settings repository methods

**Benefits**:
- Users can like/dislike multiple profiles without the app closing
- Users can change settings without the app closing
- All actions are still synced to the bot when profile is submitted
- No data loss - everything is queued locally and sent together

**User Experience**:
- Like/dislike actions: Queued locally with visual feedback
- Settings changes: Saved locally with confirmation message
- Profile submission: Sends profile + queued interactions + settings together
- App only closes when user explicitly submits profile or deletes it

### Issue #4: /debug Command Fails Without Database Connection
**Status**: Fixed ‚úÖ

**Problem**: The `/debug` command would fail if the database was not available, making it useless for debugging database connection issues.

**Solution**: Made the `/debug` command more resilient by wrapping database-dependent sections in proper exception handling.

**Changes** (`bot/main.py`):

1. **Improved error handling**:
   - Wrapped `track_command()` in try/except to prevent failure
   - Separated repository availability check from connection test
   - Added separate handling for `RuntimeError` (repository not available) vs other exceptions

2. **Added helpful status messages**:
   - "Repository Not Available" message when bot not properly initialized
   - "This is expected if bot started without database" note
   - Database statistics section shows "Not available (database not connected)" when DB unavailable
   - Added "Notes" section at the end with overall status summary

3. **Enhanced docstring**:
   - Updated to clarify that command works even without database connection
   - Helps with debugging issues

**Benefits**:
- `/debug` command always works, even without database
- Provides clear diagnostic information about what's available and what's not
- Helps debug initialization and connection issues
- Shows helpful hints about expected states

**Example Output** (without database):
```
üîß Debug Information

üì± Bot Status:
  ‚úÖ Bot Running
  ‚Ä¢ ID: 123456789
  ‚Ä¢ Username: @mybot
  ‚Ä¢ Name: My Bot

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration:

  ‚Ä¢ Database: postgresql+asyncpg://user:***@localhost:5432/db

üóÑÔ∏è Database Connection:

     This is expected if bot started without database

üìä Database Statistics:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Not available (database not connected)

[... environment and system info ...]

‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes:
  ‚Ä¢ Database not connected - some features unavailable
```

## Testing

### New Tests Added

1. **`tests/test_webapp_handler.py`**:
   - `test_webapp_handler_processes_queued_interactions`: Tests that queued like/dislike actions are processed
   - `test_webapp_handler_processes_settings`: Tests that settings are synced when included in profile payload

2. **`tests/test_bot_handlers.py`**:
   - `test_debug_works_without_database`: Tests that `/debug` command works when database is unavailable

### Running Tests

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test files
pytest tests/test_webapp_handler.py
pytest tests/test_bot_handlers.py
```

## Migration Notes

### For Users
- **No action required** - changes are backward compatible
- Existing profiles and data are not affected
- UI changes are purely additive (new status messages)

### For Developers
- WebApp now queues interactions locally - check browser localStorage if debugging
- Profile payload may now include `queued_interactions` and `settings` fields
- `/debug` command is now safe to use even when database is down

## Future Improvements (Optional)

1. **Add manual sync button**: Allow users to manually sync queued interactions without submitting profile
2. **Add backend API**: Implement HTTP endpoint for real-time interaction processing without closing app
3. **Add queue visualization**: Show queued actions in UI (e.g., in navigation bar)
4. **Add periodic auto-sync**: Automatically sync queued actions every N minutes
5. **Add queue size limit**: Prevent localStorage overflow with very large queues

These improvements would require more significant architectural changes and are not included in this minimal fix.
