## 🏗️ Architecture Understanding

### Current Architecture

The project follows a **centralized data access pattern** with the following key components:

1. **Data Service (8088)** - Centralized database access for all microservices
2. **API Gateway (8080)** - Single entry point for all client requests
3. **Microservices** - Business logic services that communicate via HTTP
4. **Telegram Bot** - Handles notifications and WebApp integration
5. **Next.js WebApp** - Modern frontend with Telegram WebApp integration

### Key Architectural Decisions

- **Centralized Data Access**: All database operations go through Data Service
- **Service Independence**: Microservices don't have direct database connections
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Single entry point for routing and load balancing
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate via HTTP APIs
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker-based deployment with Docker Compose
