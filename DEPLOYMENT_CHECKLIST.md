## Pre-Deployment

- [x] All tests passing (206/206) ✅
- [x] Code reviewed and minimal changes verified ✅
- [x] Documentation complete ✅
- [x] No breaking changes ✅

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Frontend Changes
```bash
# Deploy updated webapp/js/app.js to production
# No special steps needed - just standard deployment
```

### 2. Restart Grafana (if monitoring is running)
```bash
docker compose --profile monitoring restart grafana
# Wait 10 seconds for Grafana to fully start
sleep 10
```

### 3. Clear CDN/Cache (if applicable)
```bash
# If using CDN, invalidate cache for:
# - webapp/js/app.js
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Test Issue #1: Profile Check

**Test Scenario 1: Existing User**
1. Open miniapp as user with existing profile
2. Expected: Shows success screen ("Ваша анкета успешно создана")
3. Open browser DevTools → Console
4. Look for: No error messages related to profile check

**Test Scenario 2: New User**

3. Create profile
4. Expected: Shows success screen

**Test Scenario 3: Cache Clear (Critical Test!)**
1. Open miniapp as user with existing profile
2. Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
3. Click "Clear All" to clear localStorage
4. Reload page
5. Expected: Still shows success screen ✅ (This was the bug!)
6. Check console for: "Profile found in database, updating localStorage"

### ✅ Test Issue #2: iOS Photo Upload

**Test on iPhone (Critical!)**
1. Open miniapp in Telegram on iPhone
2. Start profile creation
3. Tap first photo slot
4. Expected: Photo gallery opens AND STAYS OPEN ✅
5. Select a photo
6. Expected: Photo appears in slot
7. Repeat for all 3 photo slots
8. No crashes or gallery closing unexpectedly ✅

**Test on Android (Regression Test)**
1. Same steps as iPhone
2. Should still work correctly (no regression)

### ✅ Test Issue #3: Grafana Configuration

**Test 1: Check Default Datasource**
```bash
curl -s -u admin:admin http://localhost:3000/api/datasources | jq '.[] | {name: .name, isDefault: .isDefault}'
```

Expected output:
```json
{
  "name": "Prometheus",
  "isDefault": false
}
{
  "name": "Loki",
  "isDefault": true
}
```

**Test 2: Verify Dashboards**
1. Login to Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
2. Navigate to Dashboards
3. Expected: See exactly 2 dashboards:
   - Dating App - Overview
   - Dating App - Business Metrics
4. No "Debug" dashboard ✅

**Test 3: Check Dashboard Functionality**

*Overview Dashboard:*
1. Open "Dating App - Overview"
2. Expected: Metrics load without errors
3. Check panels show data from Prometheus

*Business Metrics Dashboard:*
1. Open "Dating App - Business Metrics"  
2. Expected: Log panels load without errors
3. Check panels show data from Loki

git checkout HEAD~4 monitoring/grafana/dashboards/
docker compose --profile monitoring restart grafana
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Profile check fails with CORS error"
**Solution**: Ensure API server is running and accessible from frontend

### Issue: "Grafana shows old datasource config"
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Restart Grafana completely
docker compose --profile monitoring down
docker compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

### Issue: "iOS photo upload still crashes"
**Solution**: Check if there are any browser extensions interfering. Try in private/incognito mode.

---

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Watch These Metrics (First 24 Hours)

1. **Profile Check Errors**: Should be near zero
   ```
   Check Grafana logs for: "Profile check failed"
   ```

2. **iOS Photo Upload Success Rate**: Should improve
   ```
   Monitor error logs for iOS-specific failures
   ```

3. **Grafana Dashboard Access**: Should be stable
   ```
   Check Grafana access logs
   ```
