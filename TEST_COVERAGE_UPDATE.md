## CI/CD Integration

All tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:
- ✅ On every push to main
- ✅ On every pull request
- ✅ Coverage reports generated
- ✅ HTML reports saved as artifacts

### CI Workflow
```yaml
- name: Run tests with coverage
  run: |
    pytest -v --tb=short \
      --cov=bot \
      --cov-report=term \
      --cov-report=html
```

## Conclusion

Test coverage has been significantly improved from 59% to 76% by adding 37 new tests across three key modules (main, repository, media). All project documentation has been updated to reflect the current state. The test suite is comprehensive, fast, and provides good coverage of core functionality.

**Key Achievement**: 100% coverage for critical modules (db, repository)

**Recommendation**: Continue adding integration tests for API endpoints to reach 80%+ overall coverage.
