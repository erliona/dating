# Data Persistence Fix Summary

## 🚨 Critical Issue - RESOLVED

**Issue**: "profile and user has been deleted after recent update, DB is not PERSISTENT"

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY RESOLVED**

**Date**: October 3, 2024

---

## What Was Wrong

The database **IS persistent** by design (using Docker volumes), but three problems were causing data loss:

### 1. Dangerous CI/CD Workflow ❌
The GitHub Actions deploy workflow automatically deleted the database volume when:
- The database password changed between deployments
- The `.env.previous` file was missing

**Result**: All user profiles, matches, and messages were permanently deleted during routine deployments.

### 2. Misleading Documentation ❌
Multiple documentation files instructed users to run:
```bash
docker compose down -v  # ⚠️ This DELETES ALL DATA!
```

This command was recommended for troubleshooting, but it **permanently deletes all volumes** including the database.

### 3. No Backup Tools ❌
There were no easy-to-use backup or restore scripts, making it difficult to:
- Create regular backups
- Recover from accidental data loss
- Change passwords safely

---

## What We Fixed

### ✅ 1. Fixed CI/CD Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

**Changes**:
- **Before**: Deleted volume → Lost all data
- **After**: Creates backup → Changes password → Restores data

**New behavior**:
- Password changes now preserve all data via `pg_dump` and restore
- Missing `.env.previous` no longer triggers volume deletion
- Automatic backup before any potentially destructive operation
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### ✅ 2. Updated Documentation

**Files changed**:
- `README.md` - Added critical data persistence section
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` - Strong warnings about `down -v`
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` - Safe troubleshooting alternatives
- `docker/entrypoint.sh` - Backup instructions in error messages
- `docs/REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` - Enhanced warnings
- `monitoring/QUICK_START.md` - Clarified volume types
- `monitoring/README.md` - Safe volume management

**New warnings** look like this:
```bash
# ⛔ ВНИМАНИЕ: Эта команда УДАЛИТ ВСЕ ДАННЫЕ БЕЗВОЗВРАТНО!
# - Удалит все профили пользователей
# - Удалит всю историю взаимодействий
# - Удалит все сообщения
# - Восстановление будет НЕВОЗМОЖНО без резервной копии!

# ВСЕГДА делайте резервную копию ПЕРЕД использованием:
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U dating dating > backup.sql
```

### ✅ 3. Created Backup Tools

**New scripts**:

#### `scripts/backup_database.sh`
Easy-to-use database backup script with:
- ✅ Automatic connectivity check
- ✅ Database statistics display
- ✅ Timestamped backups
- ✅ Automatic gzip compression
- ✅ Helpful output and next steps

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/backup_database.sh
# Creates: backups/db_backup_20241003_120000.sql.gz
```

#### `scripts/restore_database.sh`
Safe database restore script with:
- ✅ Pre-restore safety backup
- ✅ Confirmation prompts
- ✅ Statistics before/after
- ✅ Automatic bot restart
- ✅ Error handling

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/restore_database.sh backups/db_backup_20241003.sql.gz
```

#### `scripts/README.md`
Complete documentation for all scripts with:
- Usage examples
- Feature descriptions
- Troubleshooting guides
- Automated backup setup
- Best practices

### ✅ 4. Created Comprehensive Guide

**New file**: `docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md` (10KB+ documentation)

**Contents**:
- ⚠️ Critical warnings about dangerous commands
- ✅ Safe commands and alternatives
- 💾 Backup strategies (automated, manual, remote)
- 🔄 Restore procedures
- 🔐 Safe password change methods
- 📊 Volume management
- 🔍 Data monitoring
- 🆘 Emergency recovery
- 📋 Pre-deployment checklists

### ✅ 5. Protected Against Accidents

**Updated**: `.gitignore`

Added patterns to prevent accidental commit of sensitive backup files:
```gitignore
# Database backups
backups/
*.sql
*.sql.gz
*.sql.bz2
*_backup_*.sql*
db_backup_*
```

---

## How This Protects You Now

### During Deployments
1. ✅ Password changes **preserve all data**
2. ✅ CI/CD creates **automatic backups** before risky operations
3. ✅ Missing config files **don't trigger deletion**
4. ✅ Comprehensive **error handling** and recovery

### Daily Operations
1. ✅ **Easy backup creation** - Just run one script
2. ✅ **Safe restore** - With pre-restore backup for safety
3. ✅ **Clear warnings** - You'll know before data loss
4. ✅ **Automated backups** - Set up with provided cron examples

### Emergency Recovery
1. ✅ **Step-by-step guides** for data recovery
2. ✅ **Multiple backup methods** (SQL dump, volume backup, remote)
3. ✅ **Testing procedures** to verify backups work
4. ✅ **Safe password changes** without data loss

---

## What You Should Do Now

### 1. Set Up Automated Backups (5 minutes)

Add to your crontab:
```bash
crontab -e

# Add these lines:
# Daily backup at 2 AM
0 2 * * * cd /opt/dating && ./scripts/backup_database.sh >> /var/log/db-backup.log 2>&1

# Weekly cleanup (keep last 30 days)
0 3 * * 0 find /opt/dating/backups -name "db_backup_*.sql.gz" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### 2. Test the Backup Script (2 minutes)

```bash
cd /opt/dating
./scripts/backup_database.sh
```

You should see:
- ✅ Database connectivity check
- ✅ Current statistics
- ✅ Backup creation
- ✅ Compression
- ✅ Success message with file size

### 3. Store Backups Off-Site

Copy backups to a safe location:
```bash
# To another server
scp backups/db_backup_*.sql.gz user@backup-server:/backups/dating/

# Or to cloud storage (S3, Google Drive, etc.)
# See docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md for examples
```

### 4. Read the Guide

**Required reading**: [`docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md`](docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md)

Key sections:
- 🚨 Dangerous Commands - What to NEVER do
- ✅ Safe Commands - What to use instead
- 💾 Backup Strategy - How to protect your data
- 🔄 Restore from Backup - How to recover

### 5. Update Your Team

Share this with your team:
- ⛔ **Never** use `docker compose down -v` without backup
- ✅ **Always** create backup before risky operations
- 📖 **Read** docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md
- 🔧 **Use** the backup/restore scripts

## Verification

### Verify Volumes Are Persistent

```bash
# List Docker volumes
docker volume ls | grep dating

# You should see:
# dating_postgres_data    <- DATABASE (CRITICAL!)
# dating_traefik_certs    <- SSL certificates
# dating_photo_storage    <- Uploaded photos
# dating_prometheus_data  <- Monitoring (can be recreated)
# dating_grafana_data     <- Monitoring (can be recreated)
# dating_loki_data        <- Monitoring (can be recreated)
```

### Verify Backup Works

```bash
# Create test backup
./scripts/backup_database.sh

# Check backup exists
ls -lh backups/db_backup_*.sql.gz

# Verify backup is not empty
du -h backups/db_backup_*.sql.gz
```

### Verify Documentation is Clear

Open these files and verify warnings are visible:
- [ ] README.md - Data persistence section
- [ ] docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md - Full guide
- [ ] docs/GETTING_STARTED.md - Warning about down -v
- [ ] docs/DEPLOYMENT.md - Safe troubleshooting

## Before and After Comparison

### Before (Dangerous) ❌

```bash
# Deployment workflow
if password_changed:
    docker volume rm dating_postgres_data  # 💥 DATA LOSS!

# Documentation
"Run: docker compose down -v"  # 💥 DATA LOSS!

# No backup tools
# Manual backup commands only
```

**Result**: Data loss during normal operations

### After (Safe) ✅

```bash
# Deployment workflow
if password_changed:
    pg_dump > backup.sql              # ✅ Backup
    docker volume rm dating_postgres_data
    # Restore from backup.sql         # ✅ Restore

# Documentation
"⚠️ NEVER use down -v without backup!"
"Use ./scripts/backup_database.sh first"

# Backup tools
./scripts/backup_database.sh          # ✅ Easy backup
./scripts/restore_database.sh backup.sql.gz  # ✅ Easy restore
```

**Result**: Data protected during all operations

2. Add to cron for daily backups
3. Store backups off-site
4. Read `docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md`

### "What if I already lost data?"

1. Check for backups in `backups/` directory
2. Check remote backups (if configured)
3. Check Docker volumes (might still exist)
4. See "Emergency Recovery" in `docs/DATA_PERSISTENCE.md`

## Technical Details

### Volume Locations

```bash
# Database volume (CRITICAL - contains all app data)
/var/lib/docker/volumes/dating_postgres_data/_data/

# Photo storage (CRITICAL - contains user uploads)
/var/lib/docker/volumes/dating_photo_storage/_data/

# SSL certificates (important but can be reissued)
/var/lib/docker/volumes/dating_traefik_certs/_data/

# Monitoring data (can be recreated, not critical)
/var/lib/docker/volumes/dating_prometheus_data/_data/
/var/lib/docker/volumes/dating_grafana_data/_data/
/var/lib/docker/volumes/dating_loki_data/_data/
```

### Backup Size Estimates

- **Small deployment** (100 users): ~1-2 MB
- **Medium deployment** (1,000 users): ~10-20 MB
- **Large deployment** (10,000 users): ~100-200 MB

Compressed backups are typically 70-80% smaller.
