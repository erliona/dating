# Readonly State
- If the user says “discuss”, “plan”, “design”, “review”, or similar, DO NOT modify files yet.
- In readonly mode, respond with:
  1) a step-by-step plan,
  2) a list of target files and directories,
  3) unified diffs (patches) instead of direct edits,
  4) a test plan and rollout/backout notes.
- Ask for explicit confirmation before applying changes to the repo.
