# Docker Rebuild Hint
- Whenever suggesting code that changes dependencies, Dockerfiles, compose, or entrypoints, append a rebuild note:
  "Run: docker compose build <service> && docker compose up -d <service>"
- For Python deps: also remind to update requirements/pyproject and .env.example if needed.
- Never assume live containers pick up changes automatically.
- Never apply edits inside running containers; persistent changes must flow through git → PR → CI/CD.
